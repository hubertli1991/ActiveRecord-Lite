# ActiveRecord-Lite

## Goal

ActiveRecord-Lite connects classes to relational databases. The final goal is to set relations between different models that have `belongs_to`, `has_many` and `has_many_through` relations.

In addition, I goal is to create methods that allow you to:
  `all`,
  `find`,
  `search`, 
  `where`, 
  `insert`,
  `update`, and
  `save`
